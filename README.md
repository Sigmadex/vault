Vault for Timelock Curve

# Summary
<em>Sigmadex is researching and developing a optimal price discovery and liquidity mechanism for newly speculative assets. This mechanism, dubbed an Automated Vesting Market (AVM), has several potential applications in areas of distribution and vesting; our first exploration will delve into the use case of balancing volume against a curve while obtaining a proper price discovery over time.</em>

# Motivation
The idea of an AVM is to leverage a mathematical model, independent parameters and a smart contract architecture to handle the dynamic distribution of assets when called for by the contract owner.
